# Infaect Check
## Project ##
Long before the invention of computers and the internet, fake news was transmitted orally in the form of rumours, people innocently talking about each other's lives people or intentional alarms ruining the reputation of rival companies. Nowadays, message chats instantaneously allow new news to reach audiences never before imagined. Due to their appealing nature, they quickly spread, influencing the environment of people in severe matters, for example, on a political, economic and public health level. In this scenario, the health environment stands out as one of the most affected, containing information on matters that directly impact the life of an individual, and therefore, are searched and shared with high frequency, increasing the damage caused by fake news, in addition to expanding its area of ​​influence. In the case of a personal concern, a victim of this phenomenon can blindly trust a medical solution, which, because it's content is mostly technical, most people can't distinguish on their own whether the information received or shared is true and may lead to believe in a situation often judged to be absurd by a health professional, given the current pandemic scenario in the world.
## The Team ##
Formed by 2nd semester students of design and computer science, the Infæct Check team developed this project to understand the main bureaucratic and technical obstacles in the propagation of quality and safe information for the control of epidemics and pandemics.

## Soluction ##
The Team's soluction for the problem introduced is a sistem that has a database of keywords that will analyze a text and retrun if the text is possible a Fake news. Are focus is a bot on Whatsapp that will do all of this automatically. 

### lista.c and lista.h ###
The "lista.c" file presents a linked list that was created to allocate or store system users in memory spaces. Furthermore, it is associated directly with the user file. The "lista.h" is a library that we created to organize the code.

### usuario.c and usuario.h ###
The file "usuario.c" was created to create the user of the system using struct, because it facilitates the creation of multiple users. User registration will save the user information such as name, country code (+55), area code and mobile number. At the end it asks if you want to add a new user. The "usuario.h" is a library that we created to organize the code.

### funcionalidades.c and funcionalidades.h
The "funcionalidades.c" file was created for the system's functionalities, which has three functions: 1- View the database with the keywords; 2- Add a new keyword in the database; 3- Analyze a sentence to see if it presents a keyword. All functions feature file manipulation to store keywords, add a new word and compare with the phrase the user wants to analyze. Are focus for the project is on the third functionalitie and turn it automatic. The "funcionalidades.h" is a library that we created to organize the code.
